# 6-DOF-Robot-Manipulator-Control-via-MATLAB
University Project (Politecnico di Bari)  
A MATLAB script that, starting from the initial and final positions of the end-effector, calculates and simulates the control parameters for a refurbished KUKA IR 760/120 6-DOF manipulator and generates the corresponding G-Code file to be executed by the machine.
